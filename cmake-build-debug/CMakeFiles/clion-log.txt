CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/fengbin/Documents/Cinder/my-projects/Gomoku_Chess_Game/final-project-ffyycc/cmake-build-debug/_deps/catch2-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/fengbin/Documents/Cinder/my-projects/final-project-ffyycc/cmake-build-debug/_deps/catch2-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
